## Overview

### The challenge
- Build out the project to the designs provided
## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.section {
    background-image: url(./images/bg-pattern-card.svg);
    position: relative;
    z-index: 1;
    top: 160px;
    background-size: contain;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-color: white;
    height: 380px;
    border-radius: 5px;
  }
```
I felt good about my result placing the image on top of the other one, i took a lot of trial and errors but i did it.

### Continued development
I'm still working on my Media query and Position concepts.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp) - This helped me to understand media query a little bit. I really liked how they explained the concept.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1AhSWFcZpg) - I watched countless videos on youtube but this particular one was meanongful to me and understandable and somewhat related to the problem i was facing.
